  # For historical reasons (see {#skel} and {#secondary_groups} for some background), this is a
  # superset of the useradd configuration represented by a {UseraddConfig} object. Apart from the
  # attributes included there, this class includes mechanisms used by AutoYaST to overwrite the
  # default skel directory and to specify a default list of secondary groups.

    # with no substitute when the package "pwdutils" was dropped in favor of "shadow" (see more at
    # bsc#1099153). Even if the GROUPS key is present in /etc/default/useradd, its value will be

    # configuration of the final system. But the <user_defaults> section of the AutoYaST profile
    # allows to specify a custom skel directory. This attribute makes possible to handle that.
    # By default {#skel} just returns the value of {UseraddConfig#skel}, but this class also
